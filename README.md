üí° Interview Question: Interactive Star Rating System ‚≠ê

I worked on a small but interesting feature that was asked in an interview. This feature was built using HTML, CSS, and JavaScript to create smooth interactions and real-time feedback. The stars follow the user's hover pointer, and upon clicking, it displays the rating out of 5 along with a thank-you message for the feedback.

It was a fun and quick task to implement, showcasing how small, interactive features can enhance the overall user experience.
Let me know what you think!
